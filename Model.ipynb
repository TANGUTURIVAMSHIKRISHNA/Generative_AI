      "**Here's how it works simply:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  When you type something, the AI looks at your new message *and* it looks back at the recent messages we've exchanged (the context).\n",

      "*   Me (if I forgot the context): \"What's T-Rex? Are we still talking about ancient reptiles?\" (Confusing!)\n",
      "*   Me (using context protocol): \"Ah, T-Rex was a specific type of dinosaur...\" (Much better!)\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"protocol\" part also includes rules about limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI models can't remember *every single word* from the very beginning of a super long chat forever. There's a limit to how much \"context\" they can hold at once. It's like having a notebook where you can only fit a certain number of pages. When you add new pages, the oldest ones at the beginning might get covered up or removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the **Model Context Protocol** is just the AI's clever way of keeping track of our conversation history (the context) using a set of rules, so it can understand you better, but it also has a way of managing that memory so it doesn't get overloaded.\n",
      "\n",
